# || img2ico ||

Welcome to img2ico, a windows icon making utility. 

## Standalone app usage

Add `img2ico.exe` to your `PATH` and execute it with the image you wish to
convert as the first and only argument:

``` 
img2ico <image name>.png
```

This will create a .ico file in the same directory with the same name as the
source file.
